## 📈 How It Works

1. **User Input**  
   User enters the stock ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL, TSLA, INFY).

2. **Data Fetching**  
   Historical stock data is retrieved using the `yfinance` API.

3. **Visualization**  
   App plots interactive charts (price, volume, moving averages).

4. **Forecasting**  
   LSTM model predicts future price trends based on past data.
